# A shell opened with `docker exec -it -u coder` gets a pty owned root:tty, mode 0620, so coder can
# write to it but not read from it. Anything that opens the terminal by name then fails with
# "Permission denied" — notably gpg's passphrase prompt (pinentry, via $GPG_TTY), which breaks
# `gpg --quick-generate-key`, `pass show`, and so on.
#
# Build time (this script, as root): install a profile script. Run time (each login shell, as the
# user): if the shell's terminal isn't owned by the user, `sudo chown` it to them.
